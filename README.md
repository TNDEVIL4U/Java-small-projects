# Java Small Projects

Welcome to my Java Small Projects repository! 🚀  
This folder contains a variety of standalone Java programs that demonstrate key programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. These mini-projects are part of my journey to mastering Java fundamentals, OOP principles, and backend logic.

## 📘 What's Inside

- **Prime Number Checker** – Determines whether a number is prime using optimized logic.
- **Object Communication Simulation** – Shows interaction between classes, highlighting encapsulation and messaging.
- **Tic Tac Toe CLI Game** – A console-based game with basic AI and input validation.
- **File Reader Utility** – Reads and prints text file contents using BufferedReader.
- **Simple Calculator** – GUI-based calculator using Swing (if included).
- **Bank Account Simulator** – Demonstrates inheritance and encapsulation through banking operations.

## 💡 Skills Practiced

- Java syntax and structure  
- Loops and conditional logic  
- Object-oriented design (inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Exception handling  
- Basic file I/O  
- Command-line and simple GUI development

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open any IDE that supports Java (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
2. Clone or download this folder.
3. Navigate to the desired project directory.
4. Compile and run using your IDE or terminal:
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   java ProgramName
   ```

## 📅 Status

Currently adding new mini-projects weekly as I explore advanced topics like multithreading, backend development, and design patterns.

## 📬 Feedback

Feel free to suggest improvements, project ideas, or point out bugs! This is a continuous work-in-progress as I level up my Java skills.
